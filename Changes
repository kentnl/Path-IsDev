1.000000 2013-10-18T09:55:20Z
 [00 Supermajor Changes - Breaking Everything]
 - This release comes with many significant changes that are likely to
   break any closely built dependencies.
 - External export interface contains no visible changes, but underyling
   plumbing is under heavy construction.

 [01 Role Refactory]
 - Any existing code that relied on previous roles or base classes will be
   BROKEN by this release.
 - Roles again reimplemented and split to be more horizonal instead of
   vertically integrated.
 - This means all Heuristics need to provide a ->matches() or ->excludes()
   method now, and manually call their composite roles, and manually set
   $result_object->result(1) where relevant.

 [02 Base class removal]
 - Base classes that we're deprecated in 0.6.0 are gone now.

 [03 Version Schema Change]
 - Version scheme is now Y.nnnnnn . If this is a problem for you, this
   means you're a downstream who doesn't normalise versions yet. Please
   learn to normalise, perl upstream break your assumptions.
 - Versions will retain semantic difference, just there more "perl
   internals" friendly.

 [04 New Heuristic Match Types]
 - Now a Matcher that matches on full paths

 [05 New Negative Heuristics]
 - ::HomeDir - Excludes all the paths returned by File::HomeDir
 - ::PerlINC - Excludes all the paths in Config.pm

 [06 Updated Heuristic Sets]
 - ::Basic now includes ::HomeDir and ::PerlINC exclusions

 [07 Internals]
 - Requirement for matches to debug themselves greatly reduced.
 - Matches now only need to report context feedback via the result object
 - The result object intelligently executes relevant debugging intel

 [Dependencies::Added / runtime requires]
 - File::HomeDir

 [Dependencies::Changed / develop requires]
 - Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::KENTNL v1.9.0 → 2.000000
 - Test::Kwalitee 1.08 → 1.12

 [Dependencies::Changed / runtime requires]
 - perl v5.10.0 → 5.006

 [Dependencies::Changed / test requires]
 - Test::More 0.98 → 0.99

0.6.0 2013-10-05T17:56:06Z
 [00 Major Changes - Role Apocalypse]
 - All internals that could be rewritten to invoke roles instead of
   inheritance, have been done so.
 - Base classes for existing things still exist, and should still work,
   however, they're on borrowed time.

 [Dependencies::Added / runtime requires]
 - Role::Tiny
 - Role::Tiny::With

 [Dependencies::Removed / runtime requires]
 - parent

0.5.0 2013-10-05T15:00:12Z
 [00 Major Changes - Result Object]
 - Internals now re-written slightly to pass around a result object that
   communicates state.
 - Everywhere $path was previously used, $result_object->path is now used
   instead.
 - $result_object->path guaranteed to exist and be a ref of some kind.
 - $result_object->path automatically upgraded to Path::Tiny if provided as
   a string
 - ->matches() and ->excludes() can now record results of heuristics by
   invoking $result_object->add_reason()
 - Path::IsDev::Object->_matches($path) now exists and returns a Result
   Object for $path
 - Dumping result object will give you as much info as turning debugging on
   would

0.4.0 2013-09-27T17:48:00Z
 [00 Major Changes - Negative Heuristics]
 - Now has a system to indicate negative heuristics, to mark  given
   directories as "not dev", which cause other postive heuristics to be
   ignored.
 - One basic negative heuristic added, 'IsDev::IgnoreFile'
 - Basic Negative heuristic comes standard with the basic set.

 [!Major]
 - Now uses Class::Tiny instead of Moo internally.
 - New Heuristic VCS::Git and is part of the Basic set. ( Because I found a
   few projects where I didn't have any toolkit specific files, but I
   wanted to find the root anyway, and I assumed my own code would just
   work, but it wouldn't ... )
