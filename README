NAME
    Path::IsDev - Determine if a given Path resembles a development source
    tree

VERSION
    version 0.1.0

SYNOPSIS
        use Path::IsDev qw(is_dev);

        if( is_dev('/some/path') ) {
            ...
        } else {
            ...
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This module is more or less a bunch of heuristics for determining if a
    given path is a development tree root of some kind.

    This has many useful applications, notably ones that require behaviours
    for "installed" modules to be different to those that are still "in
    development"

ADVANCED USAGE
  Custom Sets
    "Path::IsDev" has a system of "sets" of Heuristics, in order to allow
    for pluggable and flexible heuristic types.

    Though, for the vast majority of cases, this is not required.

        use Path::IsDev is_dev => { set => 'Basic' };
        use Path::IsDev is_dev => { set => 'SomeOtherSet' , -as => 'is_dev_other' };

  Overriding the default set
    If for whatever reason the "Basic" set is insufficient, or if it false
    positives on your system for some reason, the "default" set can be
    overridden.

        export PATH_ISDEV_DEFAULT_SET="SomeOtherSet"

        ...
        use Path::IsDev qw( is_dev );
        is_dev('/some/path') # uses SomeOtherSet

    Though this will only take priority in the event the set is not
    specified during "import"

    If this poses a security concern for the user, then this security hole
    can be eliminated by declaring the set you want in code:

        export PATH_ISDEV_DEFAULT_SET="SomeOtherSet"

        ...
        use Path::IsDev  is_dev => { set => 'Basic' };
        is_dev('/some/path') # uses Basic, regardless of ENV

SECURITY
    Its conceivable, than an evil user could construct an evil set,
    containing arbitrary and vulnerable code, and possibly stash that evil
    set in a poorly secured privileged users @INC

    And if they managed to achieve that, if they could poison the privileged
    users %ENV, they could trick the privileged user into executing
    arbitrary code.

    Though granted, if you can do either of those 2 things, you're probably
    security vulnerable anyway, and granted, if you could do either of those
    2 things you could do much more evil things by the following:

        export PERL5OPT="-MEvil::Module"

    So with that in understanding, saying this modules default utility is
    "insecure" is mostly a bogus argument.

    And to that effect, this module does nothing to "lock down" that
    mechanism, and this module encourages you to NOT force a set, unless you
    NEED to, and strongly suggests that forcing a set for the purpose of
    security will achieve no real improvement in security, while
    simultaneously reducing utility.

    Using an "import"'ed "is_dev":

        if( is_dev( $path ) ) {

        }

    Though the actual heuristics used will be based on how "import" was
    called.

    Additionally, you can call

        Path::IsDev::is_dev

    without "import"ing anything, and it will behave exactly the same as if
    you'd imported it using

        use Path::IsDev qw( is_dev );

    That is, no "set" specification is applicable, so you'll only get the
    "default".
